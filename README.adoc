= Awesome projects for contributors

List of projects for contributors (`beginners` an `non-beginners`)

== How to start

Look for a project to contribute in the <<languages, list below>>.

I would recommend to install https://github.com/cli/cli#installation-and-upgrading[github cli^] and perform `gh repo fork [repository]`. For instance, if you want to contribute to this project, the steps are the following:

. Fork and clone the repository

  gh repo fork eddumelendez/awesome-projects-for-contributors
  cd awesome-projects-for-contributors
  git remote add upstream https://github.com/eddumelendez/awesome-projects-for-contributors.git

. Create your own branch

  git checkout -b [branch-name]

. Start hacking
. Commit your changes

  git commit -am "Insert your message"

. Create your PR (Pull request)

  gh pr create

NOTE: Make sure you have claimed the issue.
